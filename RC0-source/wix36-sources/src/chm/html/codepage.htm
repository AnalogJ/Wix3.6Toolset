  <h1>Code Pages</h1>

  <p>Code pages map character codes to actual characters, or graphemes. Code pages are also used to convert from one encoding to another.</p>

  <h2>Code Pages in Windows Installer</h2>

  <p>Windows Installer stores strings in a package according to a particular code page. A separate code page is used for the summary information stream and the rest of the package database, which includes the ActionText, Error, Property, and other tables.</p>

  <p>For more information about code pages in Windows Installer, read <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/aa367867.aspx" target="_blank">Code Page Handling</a>.</p>

  <h2>Setting the Code Page using WiX</h2>

  <p>Top-level elements like <a href="wix_xsd_Product.htm">Product</a>, <a href="wix_xsd_Module.htm">Module</a>, <a href="wix_xsd_Patch.htm">Patch</a>, and <a href="wix_xsd_PatchCreation.htm">PatchCreation</a> support a Codepage attribute. You can set this to a valid Windows code page by integer like 1252, or by web name like Windows-1252. UTF-7 and UTF-8 are not officially supported because of user interface issues. Unicode is not supported.</p>

  <p>To support authoring a single package that can be localized into multiple languages, you can set the <a href="wix_xsd_Package.htm">Package</a>/@SummaryCodepage or <a href="wix_xsd_PatchInformation.htm">PatchInformation</a>/@SummaryCodepage element to an localization expression like !(loc.SummaryCodepage). You then define the SummaryCodepage value in a <a href="wxl.htm">localization file</a>, typically ending in a .wxl extension. The root WixLocalization element also supports a Codepage attribute that is used to encode the rest of the package database.</p>

  <p>You can also set the code page to 0. In this case, Windows Installer treats strings as neutral, meaning that you can only safely use ASCII characters - the first 128 ANSI characters - but the database will be supported across Windows platforms. See <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/aa368057.aspx" target="_blank">Creating a Database with a Neutral Code Page</a> for more information.</p>
