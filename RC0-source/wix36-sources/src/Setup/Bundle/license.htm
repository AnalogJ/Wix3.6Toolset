such derivative works, in source code and object code form.</span></p>

Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under
Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise
transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and
object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the
Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor,
such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations
which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>c)
Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its
Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor
that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property
rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to
Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of
intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole
responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any.
For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to
distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that
license before distributing the Program.</span></p>

COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>Commercial
distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to
end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to
facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the
Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does
not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a
Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such
Contributor (&quot;Commercial Contributor&quot;) hereby agrees to defend and
indemnify every other Contributor (&quot;Indemnified Contributor&quot;) against
any losses, damages and costs (collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) arising from
claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the
Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a
commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to
any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement.
In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the
Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial
Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the
defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor
may participate in any such claim at its own expense. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>For
example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product
offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that
Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties
related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such
Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the
Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other
Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court
requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial
Contributor must pay those damages. </span></p>
